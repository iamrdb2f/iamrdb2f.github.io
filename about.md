# Expertise in Software Quality and Test Automation.

#### As a designer of robust test solutions, I specialize in software quality assurance with a strong focus on automation, validation best practices, and continuous integration.

> I develop and test digital systems with one goal in mind: reliability, efficiency, performance.

#### My expertise includes the design, implementation, and optimization of test campaigns, combining cutting-edge technologies (Java, Selenium, Jenkins, etc.) with Agile or DevOps environments.

#### I am proficient in various open-source tools and collaborative platforms to ensure a high level of automation, functional coverage, and defect documentation.

#### Trained at university and ISTQB-certified, I have enriched my career through collaborations in demanding banking and industrial contexts, developing solutions aligned with real business needs.

#### I am also involved in training, mentoring, and knowledge-sharing projects around Software Quality Assurance.
