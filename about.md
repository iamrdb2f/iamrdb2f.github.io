# Expertise in Software Quality and Test Automation.

As an architect of software testing solutions, I contribute to the promotion and development of software quality assurance with a strong focus on automation, advocating for best practices enablement, and continuous integration.

> I develop and test digital systems with one goal in mind: reliability, efficiency, performance and paying attention to details.

My expertise includes the design, implementation, and optimization of test campaigns, combining cutting-edge technologies (Java, Selenium, Jenkins, Bitbucket, GitHub Actions, GitLab, etc.) in Agile and DevOps environments.

I am proficient on a wide and diversified range of open-source tools and collaborative platforms to ensure a high level of automation, functional coverage, defect documentation, and velocity.

Trained at university and ISTQB-certified, I have enriched my career through collaborations in demanding banking and industrial contexts, developing solutions aligned with real business needs.

I am also involved in training, mentoring, and knowledge-sharing projects around Software Quality Assurance.
